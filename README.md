# Kivy-app
With a base from the class I have been taking this summer I finished my feel good app with some more features.

This is is a simple app where you need to login into your account to be able to use it. There is a sign in page for new users. There is also a forget password page
where you can retrieve your password with your username. Once loged in you can tell the app how you feel and it will print a quote related to this emotion. 

-added features: retrieving password page, impossible to have two usernames identical, every page has a go back to login page button, and more quotes for different emotions.
